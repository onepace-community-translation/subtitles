# Non official subtitles for One Pace

## What is this project?
This is a colaborative project aiming to translate in a faster pace the [One Pace](https://onepace.net/)<sup>1</sup> episodes from english to whatever language the community is willing to translate.

> 1. [One Pace](https://onepace.net/) is a fan project that recuts the One Piece anime in an endeavor to bring it more in line with the pacing of the original manga by Eiichiro Oda.

## Why is it non official?
The One Pace team highly values quality and is deeply committed to delivering an experience that stays faithful to Eiichiro Oda's original manga. They achieve this by translating directly from Japanese and undergoing a meticulous quality assurance process. Consequently, the translation becomes slow.

We are here to accelerate the translation by translating from the English subtitles (provided by One Pace) into multiple languages, thus broadening the reach of the One Pace project. While we may not strictly adhere to the same quality control standards as the official One Pace team, our translations maintain a high standard. Given that this is a collaborative endeavor, please feel encouraged to request corrections whenever you come across an error in our translated files.

## How to use the translated subtitles?
Just download the desired subtitle file (we use .ass<sup>2</sup> format), and use on your favorite media player. This repository is organized in three level, Language > Saga > Episodes.

> 2. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) .ass stands for Advanced Substation Alpha.

## When will x arc or episode be translated?
We create a [project](https://github.com/onepace-community-translation/subtitles/projects) for each translation happening at the moment. Look for your desired language and follow the process of the tasks. If you don't find your language, feel encouraged to start a translation.
